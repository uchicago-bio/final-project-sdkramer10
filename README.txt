My project is discussed in detail in the report.pdf file. To run the code referenced in the report, first go to the code directory, and then run

- "python CalculateBestPercentile.py" for the results discussed in the "K-Percentile Vote" section of the report
- "python SomaticMutationClassifier.py" to run the algorithm discussed  in the "K-Medians Clustering" section
- "python CalculateMedianCaller.py" to obtain the results for the "Median Variant Caller" shown in the second table
- "python CalculatePercentileVote.py <percentile>" to obtain the X percentile vote shown in the second table. For example, "python CalculatePercentileVote.py 40" calculates the 40th percentile vote
